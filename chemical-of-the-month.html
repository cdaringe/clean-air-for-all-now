It can exist as a colorless gas or as a fuming liquid, or it can be dissolved in water. When hydrogen fluoride is dissolved in water, it may be called hydrofluoric acid. Hydrogen fluoride can be released when other fluoride-containing compounds such as ammonium fluoride are combined with water. It is used for a variety of industrial processes including etching glass and cleaning in the manufacture of glass, semiconductors, computer chips and ceramics. Hydrogen fluoride is highly corrosive to all tissues. It goes easily and quickly through the skin and into the tissues in the body. There it damages the cells and causes them to not work properly. The seriousness of poisoning caused by hydrogen fluoride depends on the amount, route, and length of time of exposure, as well as the age and preexisting medical condition of the person exposed. Breathing hydrogen fluoride can damage lung tissue and cause swelling and fluid accumulation in the lungs (pulmonary edema). Skin contact with hydrogen fluoride may cause severe burns that develop after several hours and form skin ulcers. Systemic absorption occurs following skin exposure or ingestion and can lead to serious organ damage and death. Chronic inhalation exposure of humans to low levels of hydrogen fluoride has resulted in irritation and congestion of the nose, throat, and lungs. Skeletal fluorosis, a bone disease, was reported among workers chronically exposed to fluorides (including hydrogen fluoride) via inhalation. Damage to the liver, kidneys, and lungs has been observed in animals chronically exposed to hydrogen fluoride by inhalation. (1) EPA has not established a Reference Concentration (RfC) or a Reference Dose (RfD) for hydrogen fluoride.</p><br/><hr/><br/><p>Intel New Mexico uses and emits a wide variety of chemicals, many of which are toxic and present a danger to human health and to the environment. CAFA-now leadership has added this Chemical-of-the Month feature to our website because we believe that those living near the Intel plant need to know as much as possible about individual chemicals that Intel emits. Once readers have reviewed the information on this site, we suggest that they do additional research to learn more about each Chemical of the Month.</p><br/><p>Most data about the impact of toxic chemicals on human health come from studies of occupational exposure where concentrations are substantially higher than would normally be encountered outside industrial facilities, e.g., in residential neighborhoods. So too, determinations of safe concentrations of these chemicals are either based on or influenced by studies in occupational settings, and very little data are available about the impact of exposure to concentrations below the EPA-published safe levels such as would be encountered in non-occupational (e.g., residential) settings. Recently though, more work is being done to examine the potential risk of constant exposure to low levels of toxic chemicals, and several articles about that work are posted on this website on the<!-- --> <!-- --><a class="text-blue-600 visited:text-purple-800" href="/clean-air-for-all-now/articles">articles</a> <!-- -->page.<!-- --></p></div></div><footer></footer></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/chemical-of-the-month","query":{},"buildId":"N1L-RaciRSZrbQ00MzgZo","assetPrefix":"/clean-air-for-all-now","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
